    "A uma primeira análise, considerámos este dataset importante para o nosso projeto. A coluna \"Diagnosis at the Patient Level...\" poderia ser considerada como a nossa target, e as colunas \"Nodule 1\\nDiagnosis at the Nodule Level...\" e \"Nodule 2\\nDiagnosis at the Nodule Level...\" pareceram-nos também conter informações importantes. Contudo, na extração de features com pylidc, ficamos na dúvido se as informações relativamente ao nódulo 1, por exemplo, iriam corresponder ao mesmo nódulo 1 do pylidc. Desta maneira, optamos por descartar também este dataset e criar um apenas com as features extraídas com pylidc e pyradiomics."
